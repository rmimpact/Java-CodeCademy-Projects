# Java Codecademy Projects ☕️

This repository contains a collection of small Java projects and exercises completed as part of my **Codecademy Java course**.  
Each project focuses on a specific programming concept — from basic syntax and control flow to object-oriented programming, inheritance, and polymorphism.

Most of the code here was originally written in **IntelliJ IDEA**, with some adapted from Codecademy’s in-browser editor for easier reference and version control.

## 📂 Repository Structure
- Each folder represents an individual project.

## 🎯 Purpose
The main goal of this repository is to:
- Reinforce my understanding of Java fundamentals.
- Track my learning progress alongside my **Software Engineering degree**.
- Build a public portfolio of hands-on coding practice.

## 🛠 Tools Used
- **Java 8 (JDK 1.8)**
- **IntelliJ IDEA** (main IDE)
- **Git & GitHub** for version control
- **Codecademy** for guided exercises
