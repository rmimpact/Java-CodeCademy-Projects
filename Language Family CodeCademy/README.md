# Language Families 🗣️

A small Java project from the Codecademy Java course demonstrating **inheritance** and **polymorphism**.

It models how different language families share and override traits like word order, using:
- A `Language` superclass  
- Two subclasses: `Mayan` and `SinoTibetan`

### 💡 Concepts Covered
- Inheritance and polymorphism  
- Constructor chaining with `super()`  
- Method overriding  
- Conditional logic in constructors
